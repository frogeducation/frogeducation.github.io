Developers can be a rather unique breed at times, over the years Frog has had it's fair share of odd stories but this is one of my favorites from a developer who moved to Canada but continued to work for us remotely (names removed):

> My apologies for being apparently A.W.O.L for the last day but I got myself into a bit of a situation in the wilderness yesterday and only arrived home 4 hours ago (having just woken up from a much needed sleep). To cut a long story short I slept in a tent on a remote beach with bears walking past my tent all night and I literally had no sleep at all - saying I was terrified would be an understatement. I think they might have been particularly attracted to my tent as XXX had bought me a kid's tent that had glow-in-the-dark stars on the canopy.
