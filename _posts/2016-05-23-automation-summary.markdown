Whilst we were building our automaton capacity we've found building simple summarised pages of our many tests and jobs helped identify particular pain points.  As parts of our eco-system stabilised we've begun to migrate them to more user friendly web based UIs. This has changed their purpose from technical support as we developed our toolkit to product insights aiding our development teams understanding of the state of our software without manual intervention.

Here's a sneak peak of our automation dashboard for displaying the latest status from of CI suites.

Our next challenge is to consolidate these summaries inside a single UI.  For this we're using our Intranet (a copy FrogLearn) and it's development toolkit to surface the data in a friendly and customisable fashion.
