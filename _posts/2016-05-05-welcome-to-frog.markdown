The Frog Development Space is a new area written by our technical teams at Frog Education. We're hoping to share a number of insights around our working practices, our general opinions on technology and a few sneak peaks of the things we're working on.

Content created for this blog will be a direct reflection of the individuals that are contributing. Whilst the technical teams are influential in regards to the direction of our product developments they may sometimes post their own views and bring forth opinions that ultimately don't manifest themselves in our products. This content should however highlight some of the internal debates that take place at Frog Towers.

Content created for this blog is pushed unedited from the teams.  If you would like to get in touch please email us on [fdp@frogeducation.com](mailto:myname@gmail.com)
